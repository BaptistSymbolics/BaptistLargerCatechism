## Project Overview

This project serves as a collaborative, open-source hub for maintaining and preserving the Baptist Larger Catechism. Our goal is to provide a publicly accessible, freely distributable version of this important theological document that can be improved and shared by the community.

## Background

Originally hosted on [The Road of Grace](http://theroadofgrace.wordpress.com/) (now archived), this project aims to continue the work of preserving and refining this theological resource. I originally collaborated (through the comments) on the creation of this project, although the bulk (99%) of the work goes to the original creator. If you know his or her name, please let me know, so I can add it to the README.

### Project Motivation

After the original site ceased active maintenance, this project was initiated to:
- Preserve the existing work
- Provide a transparent, version-controlled document
- Enable community contributions and discussions
- Make the catechism freely available in multiple formats

## Features

- Structured data maintained in TOML format
- Version-controlled document history
- Publicly accessible PDF generation
- Open collaboration model
- Creative Commons licensed

## Releases

Current releases include downloadable PDF versions of the Baptist Larger Catechism. Future plans include:
- Multiple print-ready formats
- Versioned releases
- Potential additional Baptist theological documents
